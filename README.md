# Useless Advices

## Description
This is a responsive web app that randomly generates useless advices and displays it to the user.


## MVP (DOM)
The __MVP__ will cover the following:

- __Homepage:__ The homepage will present the app concept and features and provide links to the rest of the site.
- __Advices:__ A user will be able to search the advices database by typing a keyword in the searchbar, or by clicking on the Random button.
- __FAQ:__ Everything you always wanted to know about ***Useless Advices*** but were too afraid to ask.
- __Signup:__ A registration form for new users.
- __Login:__ A sign in form for existing users.


## Backlog
